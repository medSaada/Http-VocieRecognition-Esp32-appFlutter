# Http-VocieRecognition-Esp32-appFlutter
We're building a Flutter app that controls room lighting via HTTP requests to an ESP32. It's uniquely equipped with voice recognition for easy vocal control, enhancing convenience and efficiency in home lighting management.

Project Description: Smart Room Light Control App with Voice Recognition

Overview:
In this project, we aim to create a mobile app using Flutter that allows you to control the lighting in your room with both manual control through the app and voice recognition. We will integrate the app with an ESP32 microcontroller that communicates with the room's light source via HTTP requests. The integration of voice recognition will provide an innovative and convenient way to interact with the lighting system.

Key Features:

Mobile App Control: The project begins with the development of a Flutter mobile application. The app will have an intuitive user interface that allows users to control the room's light. Users can turn the light on/off and adjust its brightness.

ESP32 Integration: An ESP32 microcontroller will be connected to the room's light source. The app will send HTTP requests to the ESP32, which will process these requests to control the light. The ESP32 will serve as a bridge between the app and the physical light.

Voice Recognition: Voice recognition functionality will be implemented in the mobile app using a package like speech_recognition in Flutter. Users can use voice commands to control the light, such as saying "Turn on the lights" or "Dim the lights to 50%."

Security: Implement security measures to ensure that only authorized users can control the lights via the app or voice commands. This may include user authentication or a secure token system.

User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles within the app. This feature enables personalized settings and access control.

Scheduling: Implement a scheduling feature that allows users to set timers for the light. For instance, users can schedule the lights to turn on and off at specific times of the day or week.

Feedback and Notifications: The app should provide feedback to users when they issue voice commands or perform actions through the app. Additionally, it can send notifications when a scheduled action is executed.

Energy Efficiency: Incorporate energy-saving features, such as automatically adjusting the brightness based on ambient light conditions, which can be controlled through the app.

Hardware Requirements:

ESP32 microcontroller or similar.
Lighting system compatible with the ESP32 (e.g., smart bulbs or switches).
Smartphone or tablet to run the Flutter app.
Software Requirements:

Flutter for mobile app development.
Platform for ESP32 development (e.g., Arduino IDE).
Voice recognition package for Flutter.
HTTP request handling on the ESP32.
Expected Outcomes:
The Smart Room Light Control App with Voice Recognition will empower users to conveniently and efficiently manage their room's lighting. Users can control the lights through manual interaction with the app or by using voice commands. The integration of scheduling and energy-saving features further enhances the user experience and promotes energy efficiency.

This project combines software development, hardware integration, and voice recognition to create a practical and innovative solution for controlling room lighting.
